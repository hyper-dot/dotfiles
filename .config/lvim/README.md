# My LunarVim's Config file

### How to install

1. First backup the old lvim config file located at `~/.config/lvim`
```
$ mv ~/.config/lvim ~/.config/lvim.old/
```

2. Then clone this repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/Roshanpaudel111/lvim.git ~/.config/lvim --depth 1 && lvim
```
> Note : If you haven't installed `emmet_ls` then at start lunarvim it will throw an error. 

To resolve this 

3. Type `:MasonInstall emmet_ls` 

Now you can see your lunarvim opened with some plugins installing by lazy. 

Thank You !!
